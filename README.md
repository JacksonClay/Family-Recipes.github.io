# odin-recipes
Recipe Website
This is goin to be my first project within the theodinproject. 
Starting out my plan is actually to not only use this as a learning project but to keep
and store the recipes my wife and I have come across, modified, and then made our own. 
Hopefully in the end I can keep and share this with friends and family not only to share 
my recipes but to show how I started on my coding journey. 08/28/2022

My plan for this is still the same.  I need to do quite a lot of cooking to continue with this project and at the moment I just don’t have time for that. All of the pictures need to be re-done with photos of our food that we have cooked. Additionally, I need to update the style of the web pages and make them a little easier on the eyes. In time this will develop to have different pages for appetizers, desserts, meal preps for camping and outdoor adventures. It’s going to be never ending. 10/3/2022
