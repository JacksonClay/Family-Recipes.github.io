# odin-recipes
Recipe Website
This is goin to be my first project within the theodinproject. 
Starting out my plan is actually to not only use this as a learning project but to keep
and store the recipes my wife and I have come across, modified, and then made our own. 
Hopefully in the end I can keep and share this with friends and family not only to share 
my recipes but to show how I started on my coding journey. 08/28/2022
