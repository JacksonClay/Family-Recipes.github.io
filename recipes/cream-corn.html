 <h3>A perfect savory cream corn that is easily modified</h3>
 <p>This dish is so good I had to talk the original recipe out of a Texas smoke house owner, "Ronnie's BBQ" in Johnson City, Texas. I think she was blown away from me asking her but she gave it to me anyway. Extremely nice woman and very good food at the restaurant. If you are ever in the area it is a must try! </p>
 <p>I am going to give you a few easy modifications to this recipe. Originally it was a basic cream corn but, I have thrown a couple twists in I will include incase you want to mix it up a bit!</p>
 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>2 cans kernelled corn</li>
 <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
 <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
 <li>1 package of cream cheese</li>
 <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
 <li>splash of whole milk</li>
 <li>1/4 cup of sugar</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>Melt butter in pan and cook down onion.</li>
  <li>Add corn and cook just until the corn is hot.</li>
  <li>Add brick of cream cheese and sour cream, stir until fully melted, then add milk and sugar;mix.</li>
  <li>Using an emulcifier or blender, blend up most of, but not all corn.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>That's it!</h2>
  <h3>Extras</h3>
  
  <p>I like to make more of a southwestern style cream corn and add in some peppers ot the mix. I add 1 jalapeno and one reed chile pepper. Dice and remove seeds and cook down with the onion. You can leave the seeds for extra heat.  </p>
  
  <p>My wife and I have also tried experimenting with using a box of Jiffy corn bread mix and baking into a casserole. However, we have'nt perfected it so I don't have specs for that!</p>
