 <h3>An amazing cut of meat you can make bold and tangy or sweet and spicy. </h3>
 
      <p>I have made this many times. First thing I want to say is that it doesn't come out right every time. It takes time and patients to get it right. It is not a cheap cut of meat and it hurts when it does not come out according to planned. That being said, do a little research and figure out specifically how you want to cook yours!</p>
  
      <p>I have tried to make this recipe to show an easy-ish way of making this and I have made it come out amazing almost every time. There are never leftovers! You should either invite your friends and family over or buy some baggies nd freeze what you have left for later!</p>
 
 <h3>Let's get started!</h3>
 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
            <li>Get yourself a brisket!</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Coffee Grounds</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Onion powder</li>
            <li>Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>Your choice of juice.</li>
            <li>Spray bottle</li>
            </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
            <li>Trim your brisket how you like it, cover it in salt, and let it sit in the fridge for about 12 hours.</li>
            <li>mix uo the rest of your seasonings how you like them (mine is different every time) and then add an equal amount of coffee grounds. Leave it uncovered on the counter until it reaches room temperature.</li>
            <li>Start your smoker and set it to 180 degrees or on the smoke setting. You want it on the lowest setting possible.</li>
            <li>Once your smoker reaches temp, place your brisket in the center. you cn leave it alone for a couple hours at first.</li>
            <li>Get your bottle and put a mixture of juice and the apple cider vinegar in the bottle. Once the outside of your brisket starts drying out you want to give it a little spritz of the mixture. Every time your brisket dries out you need to moisturize the outside. This is going to become the bark and is a very important part of your brisket. Treat it right.</li>
            <li>Once your brisket reaches 160-165 degrees internally you want to wrap it. I Prefer using a butchers paper. You can also use foil. If your have a bluetooth thermometer now is the time to put it in the brisket so that you do not need to open your smoker until its done.</li>
            <li>Once your brisket reaches 200-205 internally, remove the brisket, wrap it in a towel (still in the paper or foil), and then place that inside a cooler if you have one. you can also just place it in your over if it is off and no in use.</li>
            <li>Find something else to cook and prep while you let your brisket rest. I let mine rest for at least 2 hours before I unwrap it and slice it open. You want as much of the juice as possible to stay in the brisket and not fall out. </li>
      </ol>
<h3>Extra Notes</h3>

<h4>This is usually a 14-16 hours process. If you are not going to be home this is not a good idea. I do this for big bbq's at my house or I will set an alarm for midnight and start my smoke so that way I can be done around noon-ish and place my brisket in the cooler and take it with me where I may be going. This is a crowd pleaser and it will not disappoint. I also would recommend making brisket tacos with this which I will add another recipe for this at a later time.</h4>
